# üìÅ Project Title: Albums-API-Backend

## üí° Overview

**Albums-API-Backend** is a RESTful API built using Spring Boot that powers the Albums frontend application. It provides secure authentication, album and photo management, and all necessary CRUD operations. The backend handles data persistence, user management, and enables seamless communication with the frontend through well-structured REST endpoints.
